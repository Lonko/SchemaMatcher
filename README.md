# SchemaMatcher
Java implementation of an algorithm to find the match between attributes of two different schemas.

The algorithm is expected to work with any couple of schema that represent the same kind of entity.

In particular the algorithm confronts schemas representing products from two different websources, but belonging to the same category.
